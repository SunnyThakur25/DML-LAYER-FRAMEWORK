# 🧠 DML-AI: Dynamic Meta-Learning Framework for AGI

> **Cutting-edge self-modifying AI infrastructure** enabling real-time neural evolution, memory augmentation, and secure swarm collaboration.

---

## 🚀 Summary

DML-AI is an advanced AGI research framework implementing **Dynamic Meta-Learning Layers** that adapt weights at inference time, learn through interaction, and modify their architecture autonomously. Built over six progressive phases, this system achieves:

* 🧠 **Self-modifying DML layers** via hypernetwork-driven updates
* 🔐 **Secure swarm learning** with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
* 🧠 **Reward-driven neural plasticity**
* 🧠 **Real-time code generation with AST safety enforcement**
* 📱 **Edge deployment via quantization and TorchScript**

## 🧪 Example: Reward Evaluation and Memory Update

```python
from dml.reward import RewardEvaluator
from dml.core import SafeSelfModifyingDML

dml = SafeSelfModifyingDML()
evaluator = RewardEvaluator()

output = "def greet(): print('Hello')"
reward = evaluator.evaluate_output("code", output)
evaluator.update_memory(dml, reward)
```
